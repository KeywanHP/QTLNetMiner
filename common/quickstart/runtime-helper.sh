# === The Dockerfile runtime helper ===
#
# This is used by the Knetminer container as ENTRYPOINT. It takes Knetminer client files from a fixed container
# directory and uses them to run a dataset/specie specific container instance (all datasets leverage the same built
# image). The configuration directory can dynamically be linked to an host location by mapping it as a Docker volume
# (see docker-run.sh).   
# 
# This script is designed to run a fully-functional Knetminer container or any to start Knetminer from any other host, 
# independently on Docker. In the latter case, you need to pre-install requirements manually
# and to pass the correct parameters to this script (see local-env-ex for details about this case). The best way to 
# prepare an environment to run this script is builder-helper.sh (which can be used either to build a Docker container 
# or any other environment).

# Usually it points to one of our directories under <knetminer-codebase>/species. All those directories 
# are expected to have the same structure (see the documentation for details).
# Using the files in this location, this scripts creates a final dataset-specific configuration (for both the Knteminer
# server and client applications) into $knet_cfg_dir
